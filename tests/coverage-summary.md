# Test Coverage Summary

## Overview

The Canary project has comprehensive test coverage for all major components and functionality. The test suite is built with Vitest and React Testing Library.

## Coverage Goals

- **Target**: 80% coverage for all metrics (lines, branches, functions, statements)
- **Strategy**: Test both success and failure paths for all functions

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests - Library Functions

#### TACo Service (`taco.test.ts`)
- ✅ Initialization (success/failure)
- ✅ File encryption with Dossier conditions
- ✅ File decryption with authentication
- ✅ Storage fallback chain (Codex → Pinata → IPFS)
- ✅ Trace JSON generation
- ✅ Error handling for all operations

#### IPFS Service (`ipfs.test.ts`)
- ✅ IPFS node initialization
- ✅ File upload with timeout handling
- ✅ File retrieval with gateway fallbacks
- ✅ Local node fallback
- ✅ Large file handling
- ✅ Network error recovery

#### Pinata Service (`pinata.test.ts`)
- ✅ File upload with XMLHttpRequest
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ Authentication (JWT and API keys)
- ✅ Metadata handling
- ✅ Gateway URL generation
- ✅ Connection testing

#### Codex Service (`codex.test.ts`)
- ✅ Health check with timeout
- ✅ File upload with retry logic
- ✅ File retrieval
- ✅ Network error handling
- ✅ Concurrent operations

#### Smart Contract (`contract.test.ts`)
- ✅ Dossier creation
- ✅ Check-in functionality
- ✅ User dossier queries
- ✅ Encryption condition checks
- ✅ Transaction simulation
- ✅ Error handling

#### Ethers Adapter (`ethers-adapter.test.ts`)
- ✅ Privy provider integration
- ✅ Wallet client conversion
- ✅ Fallback to window.ethereum
- ✅ Signer access
- ✅ Network handling

### 2. Component Tests

#### Onboarding Component (`Onboarding.test.tsx`)
- ✅ Step navigation
- ✅ Progress indicators
- ✅ Login flow
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Keyboard navigation
- ✅ Edge cases

#### Web3Provider Component (`Web3Provider.test.tsx`)
- ✅ Provider hierarchy
- ✅ Configuration passing
- ✅ Environment variables
- ✅ Chain configuration
- ✅ Children rendering

### 3. Integration Tests

#### Main Page Flow (`page.test.tsx`)
- ✅ Onboarding flow
- ✅ Authentication
- ✅ File encryption workflow
- ✅ Dossier management
- ✅ Check-in process
- ✅ Error recovery
- ✅ Loading states

## Running Tests

### Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific file
npm test taco.test.ts

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run with UI
npm run test:ui
```

### CI/CD Integration
- Tests run automatically on push/PR
- Coverage reports uploaded to Codecov
- PR comments with coverage delta
- Coverage artifacts archived

## Known Issues & Workarounds

1. **Module Mocking**: Some Web3 modules require special mocking setup
2. **Async Timing**: Tests use setTimeout for simulating async operations
3. **Environment Variables**: Tests mock process.env for configuration

## Future Improvements

1. E2E tests with Playwright
2. Performance benchmarks
3. Snapshot testing for components
4. Visual regression testing
5. Load testing for storage services

## Maintenance

- Update tests when adding new features
- Maintain 80% coverage threshold
- Review failed tests in CI
- Keep mocks synchronized with actual implementations
