# Canary Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

_Last updated: [DATE]_  

Canary is a decentralized, end-to-end encrypted service designed to help people safeguard and release their information on their own terms. To keep Canary safe, legal, and sustainable for everyone, all users must follow this Acceptable Use Policy.  

By using Canary, you agree not to misuse the service or enable others to do so.

## 1. Prohibited Uses

You may **not** use Canary to store, transmit, or release any of the following:

- **Illegal content**  
  - Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or any material that exploits or endangers children.  
  - Terrorist or violent extremist content.  
  - Content that violates intellectual property rights (copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets) unless you are the rights holder or have authorization.  
  - Classified, state-secret, or otherwise legally restricted materials you are not authorized to disclose.  
  - Content that would violate export controls, sanctions, or trade regulations.  

- **Harmful activity**  
  - Planning or inciting violence, harassment, stalking, or coordinated abuse.  
  - Encouraging self-harm, suicide, or dangerous acts.  
  - Distributing malware, ransomware, spyware, or other malicious code.  
  - Using Canary for phishing, fraud, scams, or other deceptive practices.  

- **Abuse of Canary infrastructure**  
  - Spamming, denial-of-service attacks, or attempts to interfere with the operation or security of Canary or its underlying networks.  
  - Attempts to bypass encryption, authentication, or other access controls.  
  - Use of Canary for high-risk or illegal financial services (e.g., money laundering).

## 2. Content Responsibility

- **You own your content.** Canary never has access to plaintext files.  
- **You are responsible.** You are solely responsible for what you encrypt, store, or release through Canary.  
- **We cannot decrypt your data.** Canary cannot access or review user content. Enforcement is limited to metadata, reports, and removal of UI references where possible.

## 3. Enforcement

Because Canary is decentralized and end-to-end encrypted, we cannot access or remove user plaintext data, or alter on-chain commitments.  

However, if we receive valid reports or lawful requests, we may:  
- Block or restrict access to Canary’s hosted interfaces, apps, or services for specific accounts or wallet addresses.  
- Remove or hide public metadata, UI references, or content indexes that we control.  
- Suspend or terminate access to optional centralized services (e.g. notifications, billing).  
- Refer matters to law enforcement where required by law.  

We cannot decrypt, delete, or prevent distribution of ciphertext stored by users or third-party networks.

## 4. Reporting Abuse

If you believe someone is misusing Canary, please contact us at: **[abuse@yourdomain.com]**.  

We will review valid reports promptly and take appropriate action within the limits of our technical and legal capabilities.

## 5. Changes

We may update this policy from time to time. Continued use of Canary after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

### TL;DR

Canary is a tool for secure, responsible information continuity — not for crime, abuse, or harm. You are accountable for your use. Don’t put us, yourself, or others at risk.
