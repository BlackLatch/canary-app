Canary Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

Canary is a decentralized, end-to-end encrypted tool that helps people safeguard and release their information on their own terms. Because of its design, we (the Canary developers) cannot access or control user plaintext data. This Acceptable Use Policy sets expectations for how Canary’s interfaces, applications, and optional hosted services may be used.

By using Canary, you agree not to misuse the service or enable others to do so.


1. Prohibited Uses

You may not use Canary’s interfaces, apps, or optional hosted services in connection with:
	•	Illegal content
	•	Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or any material that exploits or endangers children.
	•	Terrorist or violent extremist content.
	•	Content that infringes intellectual property rights unless you are the rights holder or have authorization.
	•	Classified, state-secret, or otherwise legally restricted material you are not authorized to disclose.
	•	Content that violates export controls, sanctions, or trade restrictions.
	•	Harmful activity
	•	Planning, inciting, or threatening violence, harassment, or coordinated abuse.
	•	Encouraging self-harm, suicide, or dangerous acts.
	•	Distributing malware, ransomware, spyware, or other malicious code.
	•	Phishing, fraud, scams, or other deceptive practices.
	•	Abuse of Canary infrastructure
	•	Spamming, denial-of-service, or attempts to interfere with Canary-hosted services.
	•	Attempts to bypass encryption, authentication, or access controls.
	•	Using Canary’s hosted services for unlawful or high-risk financial activities (e.g. money laundering).


2. Content Responsibility
	•	You control your data. Canary never has access to plaintext files.
	•	You are solely responsible. You bear all responsibility for the legality and safety of what you encrypt, store, or release using Canary.
	•	No content monitoring. Canary cannot access, decrypt, or review user data. Enforcement is limited to UI, metadata, and optional hosted services.


3. Enforcement

Because Canary is decentralized and end-to-end encrypted:
	•	We cannot decrypt, delete, or block distribution of ciphertext stored on user devices or third-party networks.
	•	We cannot alter on-chain commitments.

Where we do have control (e.g. hosted apps, interfaces, or services), we may:
	•	Block or restrict access for specific accounts or wallet addresses.
	•	Remove or hide public metadata, UI references, or indexes that we control.
	•	Suspend or terminate access to optional centralized services (notifications, billing, etc.).
	•	Respond to valid legal requests by referring matters to law enforcement or disabling access to Canary-hosted services.


4. Reporting Abuse

To report misuse of Canary interfaces or hosted services, contact: [abuse@canaryapp.io].
We will review valid reports promptly and take appropriate action within our technical and legal limits.


5. No Warranties & Limitation of Liability
	•	Canary is provided “as is” and “as available.”
	•	We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or uninterrupted availability.
	•	To the maximum extent permitted by law, Canary’s developers are not liable for any damages, losses, or claims arising from your use of Canary.


6. Changes

We may update this AUP from time to time. Continued use of Canary after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.


TL;DR

Canary is a tool for secure, responsible information continuity — not for crime, abuse, or harm. You are accountable for your use. Don’t put us, yourself, or others at risk.
