# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Canary project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are building a tool meant to protect freedom of expression, and we extend that spirit to our interactions — prioritizing empathy, respect, and safety for all.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being kind and respectful to others
- Actively listening and offering constructive feedback
- Welcoming different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting criticism
- Showing empathy toward others

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
- Publishing others’ private information without consent
- Sustained disruption of community spaces

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct. They may take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces — including GitHub issues, pull requests, Discord/Slack, and social channels — and also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported confidentially to the project team.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
