# Canary Law Enforcement Guidelines

_Last updated: [DATE]_  

Canary is a decentralized, end-to-end encrypted service. Our design ensures that we cannot access user plaintext data or decryption keys. These guidelines explain what Canary can and cannot provide in response to valid legal requests.  

---

## 1. What Canary Cannot Provide

Due to the system’s architecture, we cannot:  
- Decrypt, access, or share user plaintext files.  
- Provide user encryption keys, recovery phrases, or secret material.  
- Alter or delete on-chain commitments or user-stored ciphertext.  
- Prevent the distribution of content on third-party networks (e.g., IPFS, Arweave).

## 2. What Canary Can Provide

In response to valid and properly served legal requests, Canary may be able to provide:  
- **Account metadata**: Wallet addresses, account creation time, associated notification email (if provided).  
- **Service metadata**: Check-in schedules, file hash commitments, and other non-encrypted data stored on Canary-operated infrastructure.  
- **UI references**: Titles, dossier descriptions, or other user-generated metadata hosted by Canary.  
- **Hosted service records**: Information related to centralized services (e.g., billing records, email notifications).

## 3. Enforcement Actions We Can Take

If required by law or valid order, Canary may:  
- Block specific wallet addresses or accounts from accessing Canary’s hosted interfaces.  
- Remove or hide public metadata, UI references, or indexes under Canary’s control.  
- Suspend or terminate access to optional centralized services (notifications, billing).  

We cannot interfere with decentralized protocols, on-chain smart contracts, or third-party storage networks.

## 4. Contact for Legal Requests

Law enforcement agencies may contact Canary at:  

**[legal@yourdomain.com]**  

Requests must be made in writing, include appropriate legal authority, and clearly specify the information sought.  

---

## 5. Transparency

We aim to publish a Transparency Report summarizing requests we receive and how we responded, while protecting user privacy.

### Important Note

Nothing in these guidelines is intended to waive or limit any legal defenses or objections Canary may have in responding to a request.
