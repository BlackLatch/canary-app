# Canary Privacy Policy

_Last updated: [DATE]_  

Canary is built for privacy and security. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

## 1. Data We Do Not Collect

- We cannot access your plaintext files.  
- We do not hold your encryption keys, recovery phrases, or passwords.  
- We do not scan or analyze your encrypted content.  

---

## 2. Data We May Collect

To operate the service, we may collect and process:  

- **Account information**  
  - Wallet addresses (public keys) used to interact with Canary.  
  - Optional email address if you enable notifications.  

- **Service metadata**  
  - File hash commitments (not the plaintext files themselves).  
  - Check-in schedules and release rules you configure.  

- **Payment information**  
  - If you subscribe or pay for services, we may collect limited billing details (processed by third-party providers).  

- **Technical information**  
  - Limited logs for security (e.g., access times, error reports). Logs are minimized and retained only as necessary.

## 3. How We Use Data

We use the data above to:  
- Provide the Canary service (encryption, scheduling, release).  
- Send optional notifications you request (e.g., email reminders).  
- Process payments and maintain subscriptions.  
- Improve security and troubleshoot issues.  

We do not sell user data to third parties.

## 4. Sharing of Data

We may share limited data:  
- With **service providers** (e.g., email delivery, payment processors) under strict confidentiality.  
- In response to valid **legal requests** (see Law Enforcement Guidelines).  
- As part of **mergers or acquisitions**, subject to this Privacy Policy.  

We never share plaintext user content or keys.

## 5. Data Retention

- Metadata is retained only as long as necessary to provide the service.  
- Logs are minimized and deleted on a rolling basis.  
- Users may delete their optional notification accounts at any time.  

---

## 6. Security

- End-to-end encryption ensures only you and your chosen recipients can access content.  
- Canary cannot decrypt user files.  
- We apply industry-standard practices to protect metadata and hosted services.  

---

## 7. Your Choices

- Use Canary pseudonymously with only a wallet address.  
- Opt out of email notifications by not providing an email.  
- Request deletion of any optional metadata we control by contacting us.

## 8. Contact

### TL;DR

We can’t read your files. We keep only the bare minimum metadata to run the service. You’re in control.
